HOW TO INSTALL
==============

run
 $ ./configure
then
 $ make
and
 $ su
 # make install
thats it.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============
If you have Redhat 9.x installed, compilation may fail because of
a buggy openssl package. Deinstall the package and install an older version.
Then amap compiles fine. You may also take the painful way of setting
symlinks from files in the /usr/kerberos/include directory to /usr/include.
